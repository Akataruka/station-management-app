# üöâ Station Management System

A simple C++ console-based application to manage train schedules and track allocations at a station. This project simulates how trains arrive and depart from tracks and ensures optimal allocation using a priority queue and reallocation logic when delays are introduced.

## ‚ú® Features

- Add and delete trains
- Allocate tracks optimally based on arrival/departure and availability
- View upcoming trains (with options for time, count, and specific tracks)
- Introduce delays and automatically reallocate tracks
- Sort and view all trains by arrival, departure, or track
- Real-time console interaction

## üß† Core Concepts Used

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Priority Queues (Min-heaps)
- Sorting and Binary Search
- Dynamic memory management
- Encapsulation and modular design
